Star Wars Protocols

Below are six structs -- three for Jedi ("Master ...") and three for Sith ("Darth ...").  
As you can see comparing the structs, there are some powers which are specific to the Jedi, some that are specific to the Sith, and some that are common to any Force user, whether Jedi or Sith.  
Using protocols and extensions as appropriate, refactor this set of structs so that each struct is smaller and less verbose, but retains all of the functionality listed in the handout.
